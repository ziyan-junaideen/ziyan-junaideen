<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>

Twenty-three years ago, bored after playing all three games I owned, I wandered into VB6. I played with the editor until I discovered the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button would run the application. Fast forward to today, I have worked on many languages and frameworks, and Ruby on Rails is my primary specialty.

I started my Ruby career building Orpiva, an affiliate fashion website aggregating inventories of thousands of fashion outlets in Europe, allowing customers to shop for clothes and accessories in a social-media-like platform. It used OpenVision core for image processing. Its features included real-time chat, co-browsing, and an image editor with the ability to try clothes.

Then, I moved on to an online bookstore named TextBookValet. I built an inventory management app, unified message threads aggregating SMS <> Email <> in-app messaging. I familiarized myself with Bootstrap to a great extent, as I had to implement three designs during my two-year contract.

Thereafter, I joined GivingFire, a donation management platform. My first project was a SaaS website builder named ChurchFoyer. Following the completion of the project, I moved on to their flagship product - GivingFire. I worked on JSON API v1 compliant Grape Swagger-based API, a Zappier app so any organization can utilize Zapper to get updates from the platform, 3rd party integrations including SalesForce, tax statement generation, and a mobile application using Flutter.

I am currently involved with Edge Payments Technologies, a payment gateway providing services to merchants deemed high-risk by traditional payment gateways. I have worked on a variety of features, including VertyGoodSecurity, EverVault, RS2 (payment processor), Moov (payment processor), and NMI (payment processor). I have also worked on ApplePay and GooglePay integration.

I love to write, DIY, and drive. But lately, I have been swamped. I had a target to write 72 articles this year, but I haven't gone past 6. I also planned to have my first product launch in 2023, but as of November, it is still under development. While 2023 was great, I plan to make 2024 significantly better.
